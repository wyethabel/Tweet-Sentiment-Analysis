# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
This project was focused on using one of HuggingFace's sentiment analysis models in order to process about 52,000 tweets. As I was unable to get developer access for the Twitter API at the time, I opted to use a collection of tweets from popular accounts from about 5-10 years ago.

The repo consists of 2 data files with one being the inital tweets and the other holding the analysed content, and the notebook used to perform basic exploratory analysis and to run the model. To view the brunt of the code, please view the notebook directly. The notebook holds multiple visual aids that help look more into the data contained.

For example a count of the tweets from each popular account at the time:

Note that the model used here, I would not recommend running again as it took some time to process all 52,000 tweets.
